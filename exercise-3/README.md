# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

# Git Status

Code: `git status`

Function:
  1. Checks if any changes have been made to files in a repository.
  2. Displays status of files as either <font color = green> green </font> or <font color = red> red </font> text
    * <font color = green> Green text </font> means changes have been added but not commited (done with `git commit` command)
    * <font color = red> Red text </font> means changes have been made but not added (done with `git add` command)
